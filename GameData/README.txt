Kerbal: Mostly Harmless

A mod that adds faster-than-light propulsion (called the NRE Drive, short for Nexus Realm Explorer)
These can:
- Do FTL Similar to an alcubierre drive, referred to as supercruise
- Jumping between Celestial bodies(referred to as leaping) modes.
This drive is inspired, but not meant to be a replica, of the Frame Shift Drive from Elite: Dangerous.
For more information, please refer to the forum post on the Kerbal Space Program forums.
